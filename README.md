The "YouTube Video Summarizer" is an application that streamlines the process of summarizing YouTube video transcripts. Users input a YouTube video link, and the app extracts the video's transcript using the YouTube Transcript API. Leveraging Generative AI model, Gemini Pro, the application then generates detailed notes based on a predefined prompt. The prompt instructs the model to summarize the entire video.

This project aims to enhance accessibility to valuable content by providing users with comprehensive summaries of YouTube videos. The user-friendly interface allows individuals to easily obtain detailed notes from video transcripts, facilitating efficient information consumption. The integration of advanced technologies like Generative AI demonstrates a commitment to leveraging state-of-the-art tools for content summarization. Whether for educational purposes, research, or quick information retrieval, the "YouTube Transcript to Detailed Notes Converter" empowers users to efficiently grasp key insights from video content, transforming lengthy transcripts into succinct and informative summaries.
